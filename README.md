A collection of tools and resources for Tales of Berseria.

# ImHex Patterns
The `hexpat` directory contains pattern files for [ImHex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex):
* `scpackr.hexpat`: `.SCPACKR` script package files.
* `tofhdb.hexpat`: Unencrypted TLDAT header files.

# TLTool
A tool for unpacking and repacking `.TLDAT` and `.SCPACKR` package files. Support for encrypted TLDAT packages (those that have a FILEHEADER.TOFHDA file) is not yet implemented. `.SCPACKR` files contain Lua scripts that implement UI and gameplay elements.
