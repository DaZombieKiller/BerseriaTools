# Tales of Berseria Tools
A collection of tools and resources for Tales of Berseria.

# ImHex Patterns
The `hexpat` directory contains pattern files for [ImHex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex):
* `scpack.hexpat`: `.SCPACK` script package files (`.SCPACKR`/`.SCPACKD`).
* `tofhdb.hexpat`: Unencrypted TLDAT header files.

# TLTool
A tool for unpacking and repacking `.TLDAT` and `.SCPACK` package files. Support for encrypted TLDAT packages (those that have a FILEHEADER.TOFHDA file) is not yet implemented. `.SCPACK` files contain Lua scripts that implement UI and gameplay elements.
